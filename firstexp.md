<h1>Creating your first experience</h1>
<p>Welcome to the LocalMuch Host Community! Let's get started with creating your first experience.</p>
<p>It is important to take some time to come up with the right experience. We think a good experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draws on your passion and knowledge;</li>
<li>Shows guests a side of your city they might not otherwise see;</li>
<li>Can take two or four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've got a great idea, it's time to get building!</p>
<h2>Building your experience</h2>
<p>To get started, go to your profile, then click 'Create new experience'.</p>
![Create new experience](/assets/images/createexperience.gif){:class="img-responsive"}
<p>Choose a title for your experience. The title is the first thing people will read about your experience, so make it catchy and to the point.</p>
![Add title](/assets/images/title.gif){:class="img-responsive"}
<p>Add some short points describing the experience. There should be at least three short points. These are the second thing a guest will read so should provide more details to convince them to click on your experience.</p>
![Add dotpoints](/assets/images/points.gif){:class="img-responsive"}
<p>Next add a description of the experience. This should make sure the guest understands exactly what the experience entails.</p>

<p>The map allows you to show guests the areas where you'll be taking them. Place up to four pins on the map. The map is also used for search results, so it's important to be accurate.</p>
![Set map](/assets/images/map.gif){:class="img-responsive"}
<p>Next you'll need to set the maximum number of people that the experience can take, and pricing. You don't have to offer 2-hour and 4-hour options, you just have to offer one. If you do offer both, we suggest that the 4-hour experience is priced less than twice the 2-hour experience, so there's an incentive for guests to chose the longer experience.</p>

<p>It is important to add either a meeting point or pickup availability. The pickup option allows free text entry, so you can describe the areas where pickup is available.</p>

<p>Add some categories which describe your experience, and hit save!</p>

<p>Finally, now you have an idea of what your experience is, you should upload some pictures. Be sure to pick images which get guests excited and show the vibrancy of your experience. The top picture will be used as the thumbnail for your experience.</p>
<p>Ensure all your images are in high resolution so our guests have the best experience when viewing them.</p>

<p><strong>If you've selected 'Submit review for experience', you must complete every section before saving. Your experience will then be reviewed by us and if approved, made available.</p>
<p>Now head over to your experiences and you'll see your experience in the Pending section if it was submitted for review.</p>
