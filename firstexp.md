<h1>Creating your first experience</h1>
<p>Welcome to the LocalMuch Host Community! Let's get started with creating your first experience.</p>
<p>It is important to take some time to come up with the right experience. We think a good experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draws on your passion and knowledge;</li>
<li>Shows guests a side of your city they might not otherwise see;</li>
<li>Can take two or four hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've got a great idea, it's time to get building!</p>
<h2>Building your experience</h2>
<p>To get started, go to your profile, then click 'Create new experience'.</p>
